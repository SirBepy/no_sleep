# NoSleep

A simple web page that prevents your computer from going to sleep while it's open in your browser.

## About

NoSleep is a lightweight solution for keeping your computer awake without installing any additional software. It works by running minimal JavaScript functions periodically to signal activity to your operating system.

## How It Works

The page:
- Performs small actions every 30 seconds to simulate user activity
- Displays a running timer to show how long it has been active
- Requires no installation or configuration
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Usage

Simply visit the GitHub Pages site in your browser and keep the tab open. Close the tab when you want to allow your computer to sleep normally again.

## Development

This project was created using Claude.ai, an AI assistant by Anthropic. The human behind this repository had very minimal impact on its development, primarily just requesting the functionality and publishing the results.
